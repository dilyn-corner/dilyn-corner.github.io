''De Anima. ''


''Book II.''

''Chapter 1. ''


'''412a3''': What is the soul?


'''412a6''': A particular thing is a substance. We consider this substance in three ways:# One thing of matter (NOT a particular)
# One thing of shape and form (a particular)
# One thing of the product of these two. 



Matter is potentiality, form is actuality. And this breaks up into two distinct classes: as knowledge is, and as contemplation is. 


'''412a11''': Bodies are thought to be substances – natural bodies especially. Some of these natural bodies are alive. Life is self-nourishment, growth, and decay. Thus, every natural body that ‘partakes in life’ will be a substance, but this substance will be of a composite kind. 


'''412a16''': The soul has life, and thus cannot be body, as the body exists as subject and matter. Thus, the soul is a substance of form of a natural body, which has life potentially. As substance is actuality, the soul must be the actuality of ‘a body of this kind’ – this kind being a composite substance having a soul. 


'''412a22''': Actuality has two types: as knowledge is and as contemplation is. The soul is actuality as knowledge is; waking ~ contemplation, sleep ~ possession (but NOT exercise) of knowledge. “In the same individual knowledge is in origin prior”(???) Thus, the soul is the first actuality of a body which has life potentially. 


'''412a28''': Whatever has organs are bodies of this kind. Thus, plants also have souls. 


'''412b4''': What is common to every soul? It is the first actuality of a natural body which has organs. 


'''412b10''': The soul is a substance corresponding to the principle of the thing. The soul is ‘what it is to be what it is’. For instance, if an axe had a soul, and it were to be taken away, it would no longer be an axe; it would no longer have ‘what it is to be what it was’. It would be an axe only in name and only in this way because we would call it as such. But this is a poor example because we would never claim that an axe had a soul. Souls are of natural bodies having within themselves sources of movement and rest. 


'''412b17''': Another example: if the eye were an animal, then sight would be its soul. This is the eyes substance i.e., that which corresponds to its principle. The eye is matter for sight. If it loses it’s ability to see, it is no longer an eye. 


'''413a3''': The soul (or parts of it, if it has parts) cannot be separated from the body. This is because of the fact that the actuality might in fact be in the body, or some part of the body, and not in the soul. 


''Chapter 2. ''


'''413a11''': Our definition of the soul should yield what it is and what it is for. For example, squaring is the construction of an equilateral rectangle equal to one which is not equilateral. 


'''413a20''': The soul is in that which has life, and something has life if one of the following is present: intellect, perception, movement and rest with respect to place, and movement involved in nutrition in both decay and growth. 


'''413a25''': Plants are also alive. Thus, plants have a soul.


'''413b1''': It is because of the soul that these things have life. Sense-perception is what sets the animal apart from the plant. 


'''413b4''': The nutritive part of the soul is shared by animals and plants. Animals have the sense of touch. 


'''413b11''': The soul is the source of these things. Whether these things are each souls or parts of one soul is a difficult question to answer in some cases, not in others. 


'''413b16''': The soul has the potential to be split into many but is in actuality one. This can be seen in the splitting of plants or insects into individual parts. If sense-perception is present, then so to is imagination and desire, as sense-perception yields pain and pleasure, and these necessarily bring on wanting. 


'''413b24''': The intellect and potentiality for contemplation seems to be a different kind of soul which can exist separately (from the body?) – an immortal part of the soul. 


'''413b27''': Being able to perceive is different from being able to believe as perceiving is different from believing (potential and actual?) and so these two parts of the soul are different in definition, though it is unclear if these things are separable in the ways that others are. 


'''413b32''': These parts of the soul belong to different animals in different numbers, although they may have only one, the one being touch (the most necessary one). 


'''414a4''': We speak of how we live and perceive in different ways. We say we know in the case of knowledge and the other in the case of soul. The soul is a kind of principle and form, not matter or subject. 


'''414a14''': And so substance is spoken of in three ways (matter, form, the product of the two) and matter is potentiality and form actuality. As the product of matter and form is a thing with a soul, the body is not the actuality of the soul but instead the soul is the actuality of a certain kind of body: one which experiences growth, perception, intellect, etc. 


'''414a19''': The soul does not exist without the body, but is not a body. It exists in a body of a particular kind. Our body has a soul “just as reason demands”. “For the actuality of each thing comes naturally about in that which is already such potentially and in its appropriate matter.” The soul is a kind of actuality and principle of that which has the potentiality to be such. 


''Chapter 3.''


'''414a29''': The potentialities of the soul are nutrition, sense-perception, desire, movement in respect of place, and thought. Some existing things have all of them, some a few, and others only one. 


'''414a32''': Plants have the nutritive faculty. Other animals have it and sense-perception, the lowest of which is touch. Then upon that, desire, which comprises wanting, passion, and wishing. For those that have sense-perception, there is both pleasure and pain and both the pleasant and the painful. Thus, there is wanting: the desire for that which is pleasant. 


'''414b6''': Sound, color, and smell do not contribute to nourishment, but only touch. Flavor is an object of touch, a seasoning on hot and cold. Hunger and thirst are forms of wanting. 


'''414b16''': Imagination is difficult to discuss in this hierarchy for now. Some things have movement with respect to place. Some higher beings such as men have thought and intellect. 


'''414b20''': There is no all-encapsulating definition of a soul. Just as there is no figure over and above a triangle, there is no soul over and above a soul – they’re simply different, but rely on the lower shapes (souls) for a kind of definition. 


'''414b25''': Thus it is a fruitless effort to attempt to find a definition of the soul that would fit all souls; it would necessarily be peculiar to one particular kind of soul. 


'''414b28''': “That which is prior always exists potentially in what follows in order”. Thus we must ask what is the soul of each thing individually, in man and plant and beast. 


'''414b33''': Nutritive faculty -> sense perception -> movement -> intellect. Imagination can somehow exist separately, however? It requires a further inquiry on its own. 


''Chapter 4. ''


'''415a14''': In order to inquire about the faculties of the soul one must grasp what each is and investigate what follows. But to say what the faculty of thought or perception is we must know what thinking or perceiving are: activities and actions are in respect of definition prior to their potentialities.


'''415a22''': In virtue of the fact that all souls have life, the nutritive faculty is the first potentiality of the soul. Thus, for us to speak of the nutritive faculty, we must also speak of nourishment and reproduction. For it is the most natural function in living things to produce another thing like themselves in order that they may partake of the everlasting and divine in so far as they can, for all desire that they do whatever they do in accordance with nature. As no mortal thing can last forever (no perishable thing can persist numerically one and the same). What persists is not the thing itself but something like itself, not one in number but one in species. 


'''415b8''': The soul is the first cause and first principle of the living body. The soul is a cause in three unique ways: # The being from that which the movement itself is derived
# That for the sake of which it occurs
# The essence of bodies which are ensouled





'''415b12''': Why is the soul the essence of bodies which are ensouled? For essence is the cause of existence for all things. For the living thing it is living that is existing. The cause and first principle of this is the soul. The actuality is the principle of that which is such potentially. The body has life potentially. 


'''415b15''': Why is the soul the cause as that for the sake of which? The intellect acts for the sake of something. In the same way, nature acts for the sake of something. And this something is its end. All natural bodies are instruments for the soul. 


'''415b21''': Why is the soul that from which motion in respect of place is first derived? But not all living things have this potentiality. Alteration and growth also occur in virtue of soul, and perception is a kind of alteration, but this is not movement of place. Nothing perceives which does not partake of soul. Likewise for growth and decay. 


'''415b28''': Empedocles is a moron when he claims that the Earth naturally tends down which is why plants root downwards and grow upwards (the direction fire tends to) because up and down are not universally equivalent, and in addition, what exactly holds together fire and Earth if they tend in opposite directions? They would be ripped apart! Unless something stopped them. If there is, then this is the soul and the cause of growth and nourishment. 


'''416a9''': Some believe that fire is the cause of nourishment and growth for it is the only body that appears to be nourished and grow. But to say this of plants and animals is false. It is the soul which does this. Why? Fire may grow without limit when there is something to burn, but in all naturally constituted things there is a limit and a proportion both for size and for growth. Thus, these things are the cause of the soul and not of fire. 


'''416a19''': The faculty of nutrition is distinct from the other potentialities of the soul through its function (all things are distinct in their function?). It is thought that there is a nonreciprocal relationship between what provides growth: water is food for fire, but fire does not feed water. “It seems, then, that it is especially in the simple bodies that one thing is food, the other thing is fed”. 


'''416a29''': Some say that like is fed by like, which contradicts the above position. Others think (as above) that one thing is fed by its contrary, as like is unaffected by like (fire does not feed on fire) but food is changed and digested. These changes are to an opposite state. Food is affected by what is fed, but not the reverse: the carpenter is not affected by his materials. 


'''416b3''': “It makes a difference whether the food is the last thing which is added or the first”. Both positions are right in their own way, wrong in another. 


'''416b9''': Nothing is fed which does not partake in life. Thus, what is fed is the ensouled body. Nourishment is relative to what is ensouled. “This is not accidentally”. 


'''416b11''': Beign food and being capable of producing growth are not the same. Because it is ensouled food is capable of producing growth, insofar as it is a particular it is food. The ensouled persists so long as it is fed. Thus, nourishment is the first principle of the soul to maintain life – if deprived of food, it cannot exist. 


'''416b20''': There are three things:# That which is fed
# That with which it is fed
# That which feeds



That which feeds is the primary soul; that which is fed is the body; that which it is fed is food. 


'''416b23''': The primary soul will be that which can generate something like itself (sustain itself?).


'''416b25''': That with which one feeds is twofold (analogy: the one moving and the one being moved). Necessary: food should be capable of being digested. Heat effects the digestion. Thus, the ensouled thing has heat. 


''Chapter 5.''


'''416b32''': Let us move on to perception. Perception is being moved and affected. It is a kind of alteration. Some say that like is affected by like, but this has already been dismissed. 


'''417a2''': Why does perception of the senses themselves not occur? Why must their be other objects to be perceived, if they are made of fire and earth, which is what is thought to be the cuase of perception? The faculty of sense-perception is not an activity but is potential only. Just as something does not burn itself without being burned – if it burnt itself, there would be no fire doing the burning (but this is not so). 


'''417a9''': Perception will be spoken of both actually and potentially, and likewise for the thing being perceived. 


'''417a14''': Being affected, being moved, and acting are the same, as movement is a kind of activity. But there is something being moved and something doing the moving. In this way like affects like, and also like affects unlike. The unlike is what is affected; once it is affected, however, it becomes like. 


'''417a21''': We are currently not properly speaking of potentiality and actuality and must make a distinction. There are knowers who have knowledge, there are knowers who have knowledge of grammar. These both have capacity but of a different kind. The former because his kind os the same sort. The other because he can contemplate if he wishes, so long as he is not precluded from doing so. Thirdly, there is the man who is contemplating, actually (actively) knowing a particular thing. The first two are being potential knowers and then become actual knowers. 


'''417b2''': Being affected is a kind of destruction of something by its contrary, and is also the preservation of that which is so potentially by what is so actually and is like it in the way that potentiality may be like an actuality. That which has knowledge comes to contemplate. Thus it is wrong to say that something which understands becomes changed when it understands – it was always such, simply not in the right state. 


'''417b16''': Actual perception is of particulars, while knowledge is of universals. Universals are somehow in the soul itself. There must, however, be an object of perception, and thus perception and knowledge are different. 


'''417b29''': To be affected: a boy is a potential general. 

To be altered: a man who is such. 


'''418a3''': “That which can perceive is, as we have said, potentially such as the object of perception already is actually”. It is not like the object (at first). Once it has been affected by it, it has become like it – it is such as it is. 


''Chapter 6.''


''Chapter 7. ''


''Chapter 8. ''


''Chapter 9. ''


''Chapter 10. ''


'''422a8''': The object of taste is flavor, which is the form of the matter – the matter being moisture. The perception of taste comes not from a medium but from the object mixing with moisture. 


'''422a20''': Sight is of both the visible and the invisible, like hearing is of the audible and the inaudible. (darkness is invisible – it is something that we see; we perceive darkness). Taste is likewise of the tasteable and the tasteless. The tasteless is that which has little or poor flavor or is destructive of the taste. The drinkable is also an object of taste (and is common between taste and touch), and this distinction is also seen with the drinkable and the undrinkable. 


'''422a34''': The sense organ for taste must be (capable of being) moistened. The tongue must not be too wet nor too dry, or else it will not perceive taste. The sick perceive all things as bitter because their tongues are too moist. 


'''422b10''': The kinds of flavor are opposites: sweet vs bitter, the oily vs the salt, the pungent vs the rough vs the astringent vs the sharp. 

That which can taste can do so potentially, that which makes it so actually is the object of taste. 


''Chapter 11. ''


'''422b17''': It is a problem for the sense of touch if it is many instead of one, as the objects perceptible by touch must also be many. But the medium is the flesh, the sense-organ is something different; something internal. Every sense is concerned with opposites: sight with white and black, hearing with high and low pitch, taste with bitter and sweet. For touch there are many objects: hot and cold, dry and wet, rough and smooth. But there are also other pairs for the other sense as well. For sound, there is loudness and softness, the smoothness and roughness of the voice, etc. Likewise, for color. But what the singular thing is for touch like there is for sound is a mystery. 


'''422b34''': Suppose that the sense-organ for touch were the flesh. If we were to wrap a thin membrane around the flesh and were to touch something with it, the sensation of touch would be perceived just as quickly as before. And were it the case that the air were like this membrane, we would perceive color and sound and smell through this medium and would consider them all to be of one sense. But the sense organs are clearly distinct. But in the case of touch, things are unclear. The ensouled body cannot be composed of air and water, for it must bev something solid. What is left is that it must be a mixture of Earth, air, and water, as flesh tends to be. The body must be the medium for the perception of touch. Even though there is overlap in this case between the senses, they are nonetheless distinct, as it is only the tongue which perceives taste, not the whole of the body. 


'''423a22''': But a problem could be raised here: does the perception of everything take place similarly, or is it different for different things? For instance, it is currently thought that taste and touch act by contact, but sight and hearing from a distance. If everything is separated by air (as two objects submerged in water has water between the two bodies, the do not touch; so too in the air), then how does anything really touch if two bodies cannot touch while a third is between them? 


'''423b4''': But it is not the case that our senses act via contact or distance separately. Rather, every sense is through contact. Just as we perceive the hard and soft via touch, so too do we perceive odors and colors. We fail to notice the similarity because we get close when we touch and we do not get close when we see. As we perceive all things through a medium, we simply fail to recognize the medium. 


'''423b12''': But there is a difference between the objects of touch and those of sight and hearing. We perceive through sight and hearing because of how the medium acts on us, but with touch the medium acts on us and we on it, like a shield being struck by a sword. Both act on each other simultaneously. 


'''423b17''': Perception does not occur when something is in direct contact with the sense-organ, for if a body is placed directly on the eye no perception occurs. But we perceive things when they touch the skin via our sense of touch, and so the skin must be the medium through which the sense-organ perceives things. Thus, the sense-organ must be something internal. 


'''423b27''': The sense-organ of touch has touch potentially, and when it is acted on by a body that is perceived it is made as it is actually. 


'''424a2''': We do not perceive anything that is just as hot or cold, hard or soft, etc. as our sense-organ, but instead we perceive these in excess. The sense is a sort of mean between the opposites present in objects of perception. The sense-organ is potentially both extreme, and must be neither of them actually, in order for them to be perceived. Thus, that which perceives must be neither hot nor cold in the case of touch. 


'''424a10''': Just as the other senses are of their opposites, so too touch is of its own: the tangible and the intangible. With the case of air, it has only a small degree of tangibility, and is mostly intangible. 

Thus, the senses and their objects have been outlined. 


''Chapter 12. ''


'''424a17''': The sense is that which can receive perceptible forms without their matter, as wax receives the imprint of the ring without the iron or gold. Similarly, in each case of the sense, it is affected by that which has color or flavor or sound, but not because of how these are spoken of, but in virtue of the fact that they are of a particular kind in accordance with their principle. 


'''424a28''': Excess in the objects of perception destroys the sense-organs because if the movement is too violent for the sense-organ its principle is destroyed, and this is what the sense is. Plants do not perceive because their first principle is not of a kind such as to receive the forms of objects of perception – they are affected by the matter. 

'''424b3''': Can those which cannot smell be affected by smell? Or likewise for those without sight? If the object of smell is smell, then smell must produce, if anything, smelling; thus, nothing which is unable to smell is affected by it. Neither can those which perceive be affected except for as much as those things are capable of perceiving. 


''Book III. ''

''Chapter 2. ''


'''425b12''': As we perceive that we see and hear, either by sight we perceive that we see or by another sense. But then there will be the same sense for sight and the subject of sight. So either there are two senses for the same thing or sight is its own sense. 


'''425b15''': If the sense concerned with sight were different from sight, then there would be an infinite regress (for what, then, is the sense concerned with these?). Or there is some sense which is concerned with itself. 


'''425b17''': If sight is sight for itself (awareness of our seeing), we have a difficulty. If we perceive color (receptively) and if our sense-organ becomes like what has affected it, then that which sees primarily will have color – our seeing our sight will have color. That we perceive is not a single thing; we perceive lightness and darkness, but in different ways. This is why perceptions and imagings remain in the sense-organ even after the matter is gone – it has been affected by them and become like them, and our ‘seeing our sight’ allows us to see that which our sight has become like. 


'''4235b26''': The activity of the object of perception and of the sense are the same, but are the same in different ways. The actual sound and the actual hearing, for example. It is possible to have hearing and not hear, and that which sounds is not always sounding. 


'''426a2''': It is not necessary for that which produces movement to be itself moved. 


'''4246a8''': Acting and being affected are in that which is affected and not in that which acts. Activity of the object of perception and that which can perceive are in that which can perceive. In some cases, they have a name, in other cases they do not (listening and sounding each have names, but seeing has a name whilst color does not). 


'''426a15''': The activity of the object of perception and of that which can perceive are one. What it is for them to be such is not the same. They are potentially different, actually the same. The act and the object must be simultaneously destroyed and simultaneously preserved. Those who said that when sight is gone there is nothing white nor black were both right and wrong. Perception and the object of perception are spoken of in two ways, as potential and as actual. The statement holds of the latter, not of the former. 


'''426a27''': The sense is a perception. The objects in excess dissolve or destroy it. 

'''426b8''': Each sense is concerned with the object perceived by it and judges the varieties of the subject perceived by it. Thus it must be the case that there is a higher perceptive sense (as these things are objects of perception that are being judged), as it is not touch: it is necessary for that which judges to judge when it is itself touched. 


'''426b17''': It is not the case that separate senses can judge the differences between what is sensed. What is sweet is different from what is white, certainly, but sight and taste cannot tell these things apart alone. There is something that is thinking and perceiving that is making this judgement. These senses are connected. 


'''426b23''': These judgements take place contemporaneously. When it is asserted that good and bad are different, it so asserts both now and that they are different now, all at the same time. It is undivided and does this in an undivided time. 


'''426b29''': It is impossible for that which is moved to be moved in two different directions. Is what judges at the same time both numerically indivisible and undivided, while divided in what it is for it to be such? It is in one way that which is divisible and in another it is indivisible. Or is this impossible? That which is indivisible may be both opposites potentially. It becomes divided when actualized, and it is not possible for it to be both white and black. It cannot be affected simultaneously by forms of these, if perception and thought are of this kind. 


'''427a9''': That which judges the senses as being different is in one way divisible and in one way indivisible. When it considers two senses in their own respect it is two, when it considers one it is as one. Like the point: it may be judged to end a line or start another, but it can also be taken as a commonality of both when both lines are thought of together. (It’s the unifying apperception, basically, that judges the senses and what is perceived as different). 


'''427a14''': It is in this way that we say an animal is capable of perceiving. 


''Chapter 3. ''


'''427a17''': There are two distinguishing characteristics in which the soul is defined: # Motion in respect of place
# Thinking, understanding, and perceiving



Thinking and understanding are like a kind of perceiving (the soul judges and recognizes some thing). Some say that understanding and perceiving are the same. People like Empedocles took what a man understands to be what he perceives. Thinking is corporeal, like perceiving, and both perceiving and understanding to be of like by like. But perceiving and understanding are not the same, because perceiving in error is not to understand as in like by like, rather it is unlike by like. All animals have perceiving, few have understanding. Thinking is also not like perceiving, as in thinking one can be right or wrong (right being understanding, knowledge, and true belief, wrong their opposites). For perception is always true (of the special-objects). It is possible to think falsely. Thinking is found in no animal which there is not also reason, and perception is found in all animals. 

'''427b16''': Imagination is not the same kind of thinking as we may imagine things whenever we so choose to, but believing is not up to us (it is either true or false). 


'''427b24''': There are varieties of knowledge, belief, understanding, and their opposites, but this discussion is to be shelved for now. 


'''427b27''': As thought is different from perceiving and seems to include imagination and supposal, we must figure out what exactly imagination is before moving on (as it is different from thinking, as seen from '''427b16'''). If imagination is a literal perception of an image as it appears before us and not some kind of metaphor, then is it a potentiality or disposition in virtue of which we judge correct or incorrect? Like perception, belief, knowledge, and intellect. 


'''428a5''': It is not perception, as follows: perception is either a potentiality (sight) or an activity (seeing). But something can appear to us even though neither of these is present (things in dreams). Secondly, perception is always present, but not imagination. If they were the same in actuality, all matter of beasts would have imagination. It seems that this is not the case. Perceptions are always true, whilst imagings are for the most part false. 


'''428a16''': Nor will imagination be those which are always correct (knowledge, intellect) for imagination can be false. Is imagination belief then? Beliefs may be either true or false. Conviction follows from belief (for it is not possible to believe things and not be convinced of them), and while no beast has conviction, many have imagination. For every beliefs implies conviction, conviction implies being persuaded, and persuasion implies reason; some beasts have imagination, but none reason. 


'''428a24''': Imagination will therefore be neither belief together with perception, nor belief through perception, nor a blend of belief and perception. Belief will have as object nothing else but that which is the object of the perception. It will be the blend of the belief in white and the perception of white that will be imagination. It does not come about through mixed perception and belief, nor when we belief a true supposition but perceive it falsely (the sun being small, but believed to be larger than the Earth). Imagination is not any one of these things nor is it formed from them. 


'''428b10''': Imagination is thought to be a kind of movement and not to occur apart from sense-perception. It is possible for the possessor of sense-perception to do and be affected by many things, and it may be both true and false. 


'''428b17''': This happens for the following reasons: first, perception of the special-objects is true or liable to falsity of the least possible extent (they are the most true perceptions – the white is white is true or most true compared to the other (common) objects). Secondly it is perceived that the incidentals of those objects are so (this is where the error may begin). We are not mistaken as to whether a thing is white, but whether it is this thing or that thing we may be mistaken. Third, we perceive the common-objects which are of the incidental-objects which the special-objects are of. It is of these we can be most wrong. (Magnitude and movement). 

'''428b25''': The movement that arises from sense-perception will differ as it comes from each of these three things. The first is true as long as perception is present, the others false when it is present or absent. Most especially false when the perceived is far away. 


'''428b30''': Imagination is a movement taking place as a result of actual sense-perception. Because imaginations persist and are similar to perceptions, animals may do things according to their imaginations because they lack reason, and man may do things according to his imaginations because of passion, disease, or sleep. Let this suffice for the discussion of imagination.

''Nicomachean Ethics''


''Book I. ''

''Chapter 1. ''


Every action seems to be towards the end of some good. Some goods are activities, while some goods are products. In the case of the latter, the product must be greater than the parts, as it is the better good of them all, and they all went into putting it together. And there are many sorts of actions, thus their ends are many. The end of medicine is health; the end of generalship is victory. The goods that come under these categories are less than the goods which they produce for it is for these ‘higher’ goods (‘higher’ in the hierarchy in this case) are what the ‘lower’ goods are done for the sake of – and thus must be greater. 


''Chapter 2.''


But the things for which we do for the sake of other things must have some sort of limit, some ultimate thing for which we do all things. For otherwise, we would have an infinite sequence of things which we do, and so our desires would be empty and vain. Thus, there is some ‘chief good’. We must figure out what it must be. Political expertise seems to be at least of this kind, for it decides everything: the expertises of the cities, who learns what and when, and up to what point. It legislates, about what we must do and what we must refrain from doing. This is the human good. So the good of the city is greater, as the good of man is fine, but the good of the city is above this (as man is in the city), and is thus ‘more godlike’. This inquiry is a political one, at least in a way. 


''Chapter 3.''


We must have an account of this ultimate good that is adequate, and so it must be precise with respect to the underlying material; fine and just things involve great variation and irregularity, so they come to seem fine and just by convention alone, and not by nature. Some goods, like wealth, seem to do us severe damage in excess. So we must start roughly and in outline, to figure out what is the actual amount of good for these kinds of things. “For it is a mark of an educated person to look for precision in each kind of inquiry just to the extent that the nature of the subject allows it”. The young are not an appropriate audience, because each man judges best what he knows (and a man who is educated in all things is a good judge without qualification), and children do not have much knowledge; they are inexperienced in the actions that constitute life. Children also have a “tendency to be led by emotions” – apparently this is a negative thing, at least in the context of a fruitful inquiry, if not to be good. “The end is not knowing things but doing them”. The deficiency “is not a matter of time” – one must be an adult, or have self-control. 








''Chapter 4.''


Both ordinary people and people of quality say that the ultimate good is ‘happiness’. They suppose that ‘living well’ and ‘doing well’ are the same thing as ‘being happy’. But they do not agree about what happiness actually is. Ordinary people call it an obvious thing that anybody would recognize, like pleasure or wealth or honor, and their choice is frequently affected by their own afflictions (health if they are sick, wealth if they are poor). Others believe that there is some separate thing that stands as good, and gives these other things their quality of being good. We must start from what we know in relation to us. Thus, in order to listen appropriately to the good and just (to be the correct audience for our endeavor) one must be well brought up; well educated. 


''Chapter 5.''


The most vulgar of people (that is, the common people) say that the good is that which is pleasurable. There are three kinds of lives that stand out here: the pleasurable life, the political life, and the life of reflection. Those who live a life of ‘graving cattle’ think that the pleasurable life is the greatest. The political life seeks honor, a life of action. However, it seems that honor is located in those doing the honoring rather than in the person receiving it. But it seems to be the case that the good is something which belongs to someone and is difficult to take away from them (a hunch). People seek honor in order to be convinced that they are good; they seek honor from people of discernment, and to be honored for excellence. Then excellence actually must be of greater value than honor anyways, and so honor cannot be the ultimate good. But one can suffer and be met with great misfortune and still be excellent, but nobody would call that man happy (except perhaps to be a fucking douche). So these things must not be those goods for which we are looking. What, then, about the life of reflection? 


''Chapter 6''. 


Then I guess we should perhaps discuss the universal good; the form of the good. Not to piss off Plato, though; “it would seem better, even imperative, certainly when it is a matter of saving the truth, to destroy even what is one’s own, especially if one is a philosopher; for while both friends and the truth are dear, the right thing is to honor the truth first”. ‘good’ is said to be in the category of ‘what it is’; quality, and relative to something. Also what is in its own right (a substance), which is by nature prior to what is relative to something (good is not an accident of things, but is instead before them). But good is spoken of in many ways as being, as well. Thus, it does not seem to be the case that good is a common form for all these things, but is instead something varying and different to all things. Also, in relation to the things corresponding to a single form is a single kind of knowledge, then there would also have to be a single kind of this knowledge of the good. But since even there are many kinds of goods under a single category, it does not seem to be the case that there is a single kind of knowledge of the good to which these things can correspond. 

The good is spoken of in two ways: that which is good for itself, and that which is good for others (useful). What sorts of goods would we suppose those that which are good in themselves are to be? Are they those that are pursued for itself, like knowledge or seeing or honors? Or is only the form of the good that which is good in itself? Well then that form is useless; it connects to no thing. Otherwise, we would expect that the definition of the good would be common to all of these different things. But these definitions are all different. So what is good must not be common to them. 


''Chapter 7''. 


So what the fuck is this good, then? Because it seems to be something different in every activity or sphere of expertise. Is it that for which everything else is done? For every activity and undertaking it is the end. Thus, if there is one end of all practical undertakings, then this is that one practicable good. IF there is more than one, then it will be these. Happiness seems most to be of the kind that is complete without qualification, for we choose it because of itself and not for anything else. But for honor, pleasure, and intelligence, we choose these things for because of themselves but also for happiness. Happiness also seems to be self-sufficient, unlike the others. By self-sufficient, however, we must not mean for oneself alone, but also for everyone else too. Thus, it is what in isolation makes life desirable and lacking in nothing. So the good is something complete and self-sufficient, being the end of our practical undertakings. But it seems that it is rather uncontroversial to say that happiness is the chief good; it would seem to be far more interesting to ask what it is, and this is in fact something that we have yet to answer in our inquiry. (Thus cometh the function argument). 

“Well, perhaps this would come about if one established the ''function'' of human beings”. In all things which have a function, like a flute-player or a sculptor, their doing well seems related to their function. Do human beings have a function, like the carpenter or the shoe-maker, or is he a do-nothing? Does the human being as a whole have a function, much like the eye, the foot, the arm, etc. (i.e., the human’s parts) have their functions? It can’t be to be alive, as this is shared by plants, and we want the human good. So nutriment and growing are not the functions we need. Likewise for perception, as this is something shared by many animals. Thus, it must be the possessing of reason that sets us apart. The active life seems to be proper in this practical sense. Thus, the human good is to have a soul which acts in accordance with excellence (and if there are more excellences than one, in accordance with the best and most complete of these). But it also must be this in a complete life; it is not enough to have a soul acting in this way for a single day. 


''Chapter 8.''


Does this account of the good align with what we know to be true? The good is divided into three things: the external, relating to the soul, and relating to the body. Those which are relating to the soul are goods in the most proper sense and to the greatest degree. Actions and soul-related activities are of this kind. Thus the account we have sketched out will be right in this sense. Likewise with respect to certain actions and activities it will also be correct, as these things are ends in themselves and thus relate to the soul and not to external things. The idea that the happy man is one who lives well and does well is also in line with our account, as that is how we have basically defined happiness. Also, those things which we would expect to belong to happiness do indeed belong to it. “It is the doers which become achievers of fine and good things”. Actions in accordance with excellence will be pleasant in themselves. But they will be good, too, and fine, and will be each of these to the highest degree, if the person of excellence is a good judge. So happiness is what is best, and finest, and pleasantest, and these qualities are undivided. 


''Chapter 9.''


Is happiness learned, a product of habituation, or training in some other way, by divine dispensation or by chance? It is reasonable to suppose that happiness is a gift of the gods. Regardless, it is one of the most god-like things. It will be something godlike and blessed, as well as something available to many, as it is available through some kind of learning or practice, as long as they are capable of excellence. So if our account is correct, then the end of political expertise is best, as it seeks to make citizens be of a certain quality (good, and doers of fine things), and so animals cannot be ‘happy’, at least not in this sense, as they cannot share in this activity.

''Chapter 1. ''


Excellence has to do with affections and actions. In response to what people do that is voluntary we praise or censure them, and for what is involuntary we feel sympathy, even pity. We must, therefore, figure out what the line is between voluntary and involuntary action with respect to excellence. The involuntary seems to be from force or by ignorance. Actions can be mixed, and we can assign the voluntariness of an action by when it happens – with reference to time. But if voluntary things come from that which is within, or is motivated by what is within, and actions are motivated by happiness, then a lot of actions would seem to be, at least in part, forced actions. So what exactly is an ''actually'' forced action? What is forced seems to be that of which the origin is external, wit the person forced contributing nothing. What comes from ignorance is all non-voluntary, and what is counter-voluntary belongs to what causes the agent pain and involves regret. Acting ''because'' of ignorance is also different from acting ''in ''ignorance. The counter voluntary actions are based on ignorance of what is affected or what the action is for, and it must cause distress to the agent and involve regret. So given what is involuntary, it must be the case that the voluntary comes from what is internal, along with knowledge of all of the particular factors that go into each action. Children and animals act counter-voluntary; things done because of temper or appetite are not counter-voluntary for this reason. The counter-voluntary would seem to be distressful, whereas what falls under appetite seems to be pleasant. 


''Chapter 2. ''


Next up for discussion: decision. Decision seems to be something highly related to excellence, and talks more of character than action. Decision is a kind of voluntary action, but is not exactly the same as the voluntary. Children and animals do not make decisions, and decisions are not made based on spurs of the moment. Decision is not shared by non-rational creatures, and so must not be something of the appetite or temper. Decision is also not wish or judgment, for decisions are about the means whilst wishes are about ends, and judgments are said to be false and true, but decisions are said to be good or bad. 


''Chapter 3. ''


Now, is it everything that can be deliberated about? What are these ‘objects of deliberation’? Not something an idiot or a madman would be concerned with, certainly. They do not deliberate about much of anything at all; they are both ignorant, and act counter-voluntarily or nonvoluntarily. But nobody deliberates about that which is eternal, like the universe or that you cannot square the circle. But likewise nobody deliberates about that which involve change, as it is about things that occur in a pattern, either by necessity or nature, or some other cause. Neither about things related to chance. Nor still about human affairs, as the Spartan concerning himself with how the Scythians govern themselves will not occur from the Spartan’s own agency. Instead, the things which we deliberate about are dependent on us and are doable. Deliberation, then, occurs where things happen in a certain way for the most part, but where it is unclear how they will in fact fall out; and where the outcome is indeterminate. We deliberate about what forwards the ends of the things we aim to do. A doctor, for instance, does not deliberate about whether or not to make his patients healthy. Rather, he deliberates about how to do so, and in what ways, differently for each occasion he must do so. But not all investigation is a deliberation about the causes (and ultimately the first cause). See, for instance, mathematical investigation. However, all deliberation is an investigation. 


''Chapter 4. ''


The objects of our wishes are, supposedly, what is good. But it is the wishes of the excellent person which are the truly good things – all others are deceived about their wishes being the truly good. This deception seems to come about through pleasure, for things that are pleasurable are the things which may appear good whilst not being so. 


''Chapter 5. ''


What is wished for is the end. What is deliberated about and decided on are things that forward the end. Thus, the actions of deliberation will be based on decision and will be voluntary. These are the things which are actions of excellences. If it depends on us to do fine things and shameful things, then being decent or worthless also depends on us. It is not involuntarily that the unjust man became so, for the cause was in himself. But once he has become so, he can no longer stop – he is now an unjust man. Aiming at the end will not be self-chosen, but one must be born with the capacity for a kind of sight by which to discriminate well and choose what is truly good, and the person who has this capacity by nature will be the one who counts as ‘naturally well endowed’; for it is the greatest and finest of things, and something it will not be possible to get from anyone else, or to learn from anyone – rather, one will have it in just the form in which it was born in one, and to have been born well and beautifully endowed in this respect will be to be naturally well endowed in the full and true sense. 


''Book IV. ''


''Chapter 9. ''


''Book V. ''


''Chapter 1. ''


So what is justice? What sorts of actions does justice relate to, what is it an intermediate state of, and what is it between? How does it relate to things? People frequently use “justice” to refer to that which makes people act justly and desire doing the just thing. Let this be our starting point. Now, capacities relate to a pair of contraries, while a disposition relates only to a member of the pair. Justice seems to be more like a disposition. And by knowing one of the pairs of the contrary, we can determine what the other is. So let us examine, then, what injustice is, so as to determine what justice is. People regard the law-breaker and the unequal-minded person as unjust. Thus, the one who abides by the law and is equal-minded is a just person. In this case, the just is what is lawful and what is equal. Thus it is clear that everything that is in accordance with the law is just. But justice seems to come in two pieces; how it relates to others (justice) and how it is (excellence). 


''Chapter 2. ''


But we are looking for the justice that is excellence. Examining what is unjust, we recognize one kind: when someone is cowardly, or resorting to verbal abuse, or avarice. These people are not looking to get more for themselves, but instead are lacking in these excellent qualities. While on the other hand, those who are trying to gain an unfair share are unjust in the sense of contrary to law. So then it is clear that there are multiple kinds of justice, and there is a kind of justice over and above excellence as a whole. 


''Chapter 3. ''


The just has four terms that take part in describing it; it is a kind of relation between things. It is an intermediate and it is relative to the things around it. Think of it as a proportion: a/b = c/d, and likewise (as a result) a/c = b/d. This describes a relation between the ends of justice, and what it sits between.

There is a difference between inquiry and deliberation. Deliberation is an inquiry into a particular kind of thing – it is of particulars. We must grasp the nature of excellence in our deliberation, and determine with whether it is of scientific knowledge, opinion, skill, or conjecture. It isn’t scientific knowledge, as men do not inquire about what we know about, but instead our deliberations are inquiries and calculations. It is also not conjecture, as this is something without reason and quick, whilst deliberation takes time. Deliberation is also not opinion nor knowledge, as there is no such thing as ‘correct’ knowledge or opinion (for knowledge to actually be considered knowledge it must be without error), and correct opinion is just a true opinion. But someone could deliberate wrongly and make a mistake. Excellence in deliberation involves reasoning. So excellence in deliberation is a kind of correctness in thinking, and the excellence of deliberation is doing it correctly. So what is deliberation and what is it about? As there are many kinds of correctness, it can’t be all of them. Excellence in deliberation is both rightness in respect both of the end, the manner, and the time (of what, by what, and how long). Excellence in deliberation will be correctness with regard to what conduces to the end of which practical wisdom is the true apprehension. 


''Chapter 10. ''


Understanding is not the same as opinion or scientific knowledge, but it is similar to practical wisdom – they are about the same objects. However, practical wisdom issues commands, since its end is what ought to be done or not be done. Understanding, however, only judges. Understanding is not the having nor acquiring of practical wisdom, however. Understanding is applicable to the exercise of the faculty of opinion for the purpose of judging of what some one else says about matters with which practical wisdom is concerned – and of judging soundly (well and soundly are the same). Understanding – the grasping of scientific truth. 


''Chapter 11. ''


Judgment is the right discrimination of the equitable (having a good sense). Correct judgment is that which judges what is true. All of these things of which we have spoken all converge on something: particulars. They are all about particulars. Being a man of understanding and of good judgment consists in being able to judge about the things with which practical wisdom is concerned. The intelligence grasps the starting points, and the scientific understanding assumes these things and grasps the last facts – the conclusions. And these final facts are where the starting points for understanding the ends begins. We go from universals that we have as inborn facts towards particulars, to which we perceive via intuitive reason. 


''Chapter 12. ''


There are some difficulties here we should discuss. It is indeed the case as we say that some people who do just acts are not necessarily just. But they do just as the good man ought to do – following the law and such. But we would not call this man just – indeed, we began by saying that he wasn’t! So one must be in some kind of particular state when one performs these acts. One must do them as a result of choice as well as for the sake of the acts themselves. Virtue is what makes the choice correct, but how we are to carry out these acts is not to be answered by this faculty but by some other. For (reasons), it is impossible to be practically wise without being good. 




''Chapter 13. ''


Practical wisdom is to cleverness as natural virtue is to virtue in particulars. Each type of character belongs to its possessors in some sense by nature – from birth, we have particular moral qualities. The part of us which forms opinions there are two types, cleverness and practical wisdom, and so too in the moral part there are two types, natural virtue and virtue in the strict sense. The latter of these involves practical wisdom. When defining virtue we now understand why men say ‘that state which is in accordance with the right rule’; the rule is that which is in accordance with practical wisdom. But it is also in accordance with the state that implies the right rule (virtue). Practical wisdom is a right rule about such matters. Socrates was wrong to say they are forms. But Socrates thought that they were a kind of scientific knowledge. We argue that they involve a rational principle. Thus it is not possible, from what we have said, to be good in the strict sense without practical wisdom, nor practically wise without moral virtue. The presence of practical wisdom will be given all of the virtues. 




''Book VII. ''


''Chapter 1. ''


A new discussion! There are three undesirable states of character: badness, lack of self-control, and brutishness. The contrary to badness is excellence, lack of self-control is self-control. Brutishness’s contrary is… Super human excellence. Like being sired of a god. Animals cannot possess excellence (it is a rational thing, after all). The man with self-control knows that his appetites are bad and does not follow him because he follows reason. 


''Chapter 2. ''


Socrates argued that one who knows what is best cannot act in the opposite way (doing what is bad), but they do what is bad only because they are ignorant. But this is contrary to the obvious. The person who acts uncontrolledly does not think about their doing something until they are in such an affective state already. 


''Chapter 3. ''


When a person acts uncontrolledly, do they possess knowledge? Does self-control relate to kinds of pleasures and pains? Is the self-controlled the same as the resistant? Now whether this possession of knowledge is about knowing or judgment, it makes no actual difference. But where we really see the difference is whether they do what one shouldn’t when knowing one shouldn’t but not having regard to the knowledge, and doing it when actually having regard to it; this is what is astonishing.

''Chapter 1. ''


So let’s discuss pleasure. It seems to be an intrinsic part of our humanity. Taking pleasure at the right things and hating the bad also seems to be important to excellence of character. 


''Chapter 2. ''


Eudoxus declared that pleasure was the good. But things become more desirable when paired with something else that is good (like wisdom) – it is more desirable than it taken in isolation. Then it seems that pleasure is not the good, as the good does not become more good than anything else, and nothing can be desired more than the good itself (an argument from Plato). Now it would be nonsense to say that what all creatures seek is ''not ''good. This is contrary to what we see in the world. Besides, pleasure and pain are things that are sought and avoided in general. 






''Chapter 3.''


People say that pleasure cannot be the good because it is indeterminate or admits of degrees. But these same people will admit the same fact about justice, courage, etc. and want these things to be the good. Pleasure is also said to be a movement, but that is not the case: you cannot be pleased quickly like you can be walking quickly. And pleasure is not a replenishment either, as some pleasures do not come about from filling a lack or absence (for instance, there is no pain associated with coming to understand) '''argument argument argument blah blah blah''' so it seems that pleasure is not the good, nor is it the case that (some) pleasures are desirable in themselves. This is enough about the views of other people. 


''Chapter 4. ''


So let’s start over. The activity of seeing seems to be complete over any given span of time: it is not lacking in anything which by coming to be at a later time will complete its specific form. Pleasure seems to be like this. If one is pleased by something and if that pleasure goes on for a longer amount of time, the pleasure isn’t complete – they simply are pleased. So pleasure is not a movement. Every movement involves time, and is completed once what it aims to do is achieved (building, for instance). If it were a movement, it could be divided into temporal parts, and these parts would all be distinct from the whole itself (like how the parts of a building are distinct from the finished building). '''And this would also seem to follow from the fact that it is not possible to move without taking time, while it is possible to be pleased without taking time''': This seems hella fucking fishy. (“What occurs in the now is a whole of some kind”). Pleasure comes about through completed activities (thinking, seeing, etc.), and thus supervenes on this sorts of things. It “completes” the action not as a disposition does, but instead as an additional thing to have along with the thing itself. Because no activities a human performs are continuous, someone cannot also experience continuous pleasure. Without activity pleasure does not occur, and every activity is completed by pleasure. “Continuous activity is impossible for any human capacity” (1175a5). “Living is a sort of activity” (1175a12). Living is something done continuously, correct? While you do not live forever, you certainly live for your forever. 


''Chapter 5. ''


This also seems to explain why pleasures differ in kind: they are associated (complete) different activities. The activity’s own pleasure contributes to increasing the activity e.g.., the one who delights in geometry are the ones that become experts in geometry. Pleasures arising from different activities sharpen those activities and make them better. When activities compete, the one that brings about the most pleasure is what will win out, even leading to a cessation of the other activity altogether. And pains belonging to each activity will lead to the end of that activity, for doing it is painful. Thus, pleasures and pains as they relate to their activities are contrary. Desires are more distinguished from the activity that is desired than the pleasure that such an activity brings about. Indeed, it could be argued that the activity is itself the pleasure (that pleasure is activity), but it seems strange to say that thinking ''is ''pleasure. This explains the subjectivity of what is pleasant as well! What pleases the excellent man is good, as this is what it means for the man to be excellent: he knows what is good. 


''Chapter 6. ''


So now that we’ve talked about all this shit (excellence, friendship, pleasure), let’s talk about happiness. You know, that thing we started off with but were like “oh wait bro, we need to handle our shit first”. Happiness is important: it’s the final cause of a person, afterall. It’s what we are for; it’s our function. Happiness is not a disposition. Happiness then is a kind of activity, one which is desirable in itself. Happiness does not lie in amusement. The good person desires the activities which accord with his own disposition i.e., excellence.


''Chapter 7. ''


If happiness is an activity in accord with excellence than it should be an activity of the highest kind. This is the excellence of what is best. So what is this? Intelligence? Whatever it is, it is thought naturally to rule and guide, and to possess awareness of fine and divine things. This is a reflective activity: intelligence is the highest thing in us (the grasping of the universals), and objects of intelligence are the highest knowables. Further, it is the most continuous of things: reflecting is less tiring than doing, creating, making, etc. Of course, philosophy is the greatest thing to bring pleasure, as intellectual accomplishment is one of the most pleasant things and at the very least loving it is wonderful. Even with respect to the other excellences (justice, moderation, courage), we need other objects to exercise them. But this is not so with intelligence, for we can reflect and consider even when alone. So the intellectually accomplished is the most self-sufficient. Reflective activity seems to be the only kind of activity loved for the sake of itself. Nothing comes from performing the activity other than the activity itself. The complete happiness of man, then, is the activity of intelligence. But that shit is fucking godly, so we gotta settle for second best. 


''Chapter 8.''


The second happiest life is the life in accordance with the rest of excellence. These activities are human. The excellences belonging to things like courage and justice are all bound together. The excellence of intelligence is something different (of a sort of divine nature, it seems). Is excellence a matter of decisions or of doing? It seems to be both in the case of the ‘human’ excellences. The excellence of intelligence is neither; these are almost impediments.
