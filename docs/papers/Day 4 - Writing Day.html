# '''Objections/Alternatives'''



'''Objection 1''': This is an objection to my whole thesis, that there is only an apparent contradiction in Aristotle’s use of actuality and potentiality between ''the Metaphysics ''and ''De Anima''. 

Aristotle states in ''De Anima'' that “the soul is the first actuality of a natural body which has life potentially” (''DA'' II.1 412a27). However, this seems to conflict with how Aristotle describes in ''the Metaphysics'' differences between actuality and potentiality. Aristotle says that “a statue of Hermes is in the block of wood and the half-line is in the whole, because it might be separated out” (''Metaphysics'' IX.6 '''line number'''). This is the concept of second potentiality that Aristotle is describing for us. This is to be different from first actuality, which Aristotle says is “like knowledge” (''DA ''II.1 412a7), and this difference is seen best by examples listed in ''the Metaphysics''. For instance, the distinction is comparable to “that which has been wrought up to the unwrought” (''Metaphysics ''IX.6 '''line number'''). This is, as Aristotle would put it, a comparison “as substance to some sort of matter” (''Metaphysics ''IX.6 '''line number'''). That is to say, it would be a distinction of the first actuality from the second potentiality. The soul as understood in ''De Anima'' is supposed to be the first actuality in this case. However, it seems that this cannot be the case. Aristotle says that “the soul is a kind of actuality and principle of that which has the potentiality to be [ensouled]” (''DA ''II.2 414a28). While in ''the Metaphysics'', Aristotle makes the claim that “we call even the man who is not studying a man of science, if he is capable of studying”. Thus, it seems to be the case that even if a body is not alive - that is to say, not ensouled currently - that it is so potentially, and is therefore like the man who is capable of studying: the body has the potential to be ensouled in a similar way. 

'''Objection 2''': This is an objection to argument points 1, that there is a difference between between an activity and a movement. 

Aristotle not only draws a distinction between actuality and potentiality, but also between a movement and an activity in ''the'' ''Metaphysics'' IX.6. He says that numerous things are “not an action or at least not a complete one; but that movement in which the end is present in an action” (''Metaphysics ''IX.6 '''line number'''). These things are movements in virtue of their not being an end. For instance, one is seeing and has seen or is thinking and has thought, but this is contrasted with the case of building and built, or walking and walked. But this does not seem to be the case. For instance, consider a person walking from the couch in their living room to the fridge in their kitchen. Over the course of the interval in time while they are making this trip, we would say that at any particular time, they are walking and have walked to that point. In other words, they have both performed a movement and an activity simultaneously. This would be an instance of Aristotle wanting a movement to not be an activity. It might be raised as to whether or not an activity could not be considered as a movement. But it seems clear that this could indeed be the case. For instance, picture a man being asked to look at a particular thing. He (if his eyes are closed) opens his eyes, and moves his head in such a way as to look at the object in question. Now, Aristotle says that, at the same time someone is seeing they have seen. But it seems that in this case, the man is seeing for a particular reason. In other words, this man is seeing for an end. He is seeing, but he has not ''seen'' the object in question. Therefore, it seems that there are at least cases in which activities and motions are the same thing. 

'''(2) Responses'''

'''Response 1''': This objection fails to consider the fact that there is a further distinction to be made between the kinds of actuality and potentiality that there are. In particular, it fails to distinguish between that of a motion and that of an activity. This objection seems to argue that the soul is a kind of movement of the body. However, it appeals to examples Aristotle would claim are kinds of activities. While it is the case that the soul is the first actuality of the body that has life potentially and is the actuality of the ensouled body, it is not the case that the soul is a movement. If it were the case that the soul were a movement, then it would be the case that the body were travelling towards an end of being ensouled. That is to say, there would be an end to which the body did things for the sake of that would lead to it having a soul. But the unensouled body does not do anything for the sake of anything; a body lacking a soul does not ''do ''anything, as it has no life. It is only when the body is ensouled that it is capable of doing things. That is to say, at any moment when the body has life actually, it has a soul, and when it only has life in a potential sense, it does not yet have a soul. A body can only acquire a soul in the activity of becoming alive. Thus, there is a distinction to be made between motions and activities across first and second potentialities and actualities. 

'''Response 2''': (I am considering several possible responses to this objection. I’m certain you had a number of reactions to it, and I would love to hear your thoughts on this one. I think it captures the spirit of what Aristotle might be inclined to say. I really don’t want to bring the notion of time into this, so I won’t give another response I am considering – I think this one manages). 

The problem with this objection is that there is an underlying and implicit assumption in each example provided. For instance, in the first example, it is said that “over the course of the interval in time while they are making this trip, we would say that at any particular time, they are walking and have walked to that point”. This last point is very important: they have walked ''to that point''. The implicit assumption here then is the thing for the sake of which the person is walking is that particular point in question. Otherwise, it is a different ‘kind’ of walking. In this example we are considering what may be deemed ‘sub-walks’ – walks within a walk by which we judge them to be movements all on their own, each with their own unique and differnet ends. Likewise, in the second example of seeing and having seen, to objection has incorrectly applied the notion of seeing a particular thing as the end of seeing. However, this is not what seeing is. When one sees, one sees in all moments they are seeing, and they do this for the sake of seeing. While it may be the case that one is attempting to see a particular thing, this does not negate the fact that the same individual is seeing and has seen simultaneously; that is to say, they have performed an activity. Looking for a particular thing is not the same thing as seeing, and thus a different thing is being considered. 


I will be using my source as a supplement to the arguments I make in this paper. 

(These objections might not seem to be the strongest possible objections to my thesis, but they represent issues that I am struggling with when it comes to the thesis. So in this respect, I think that they are rather strong: they represent my own confusions about the topic at hand. While there may be other objections that exist and are stronger, these are the strongest and most apparent issues that I see with my thesis. If you think that these are too weak, I can definitely try to come up with some stronger objections, or possibly some kind of set of alternatives to what will be suggested in the paper. I am most definitely open to criticisms of what I have here! However, I do have a question about the form of the paper that you’re looking for [this is mostly with respect to the first objection listed above]. Can I discuss these objections as ''possible confusions'' a person might have about the nature of the distinctions being made? That is to say, they aren’t directly issues that can be taken with the thesis, but rather these are misunderstandings that a person could have about what Aristotle is saying and insofar as they are confusions they are objections one could raise, but if one were to “more properly understand Aristotle” they would recognize that these are not actually objections to Aristotle in the first place? This makes the objections seem very weak, in hindsight. I much prefer objection 2 to objection 1 – it seems much stronger.)
