ABOUT THIS WEBSITE
________________________________________________________________________________

I have been looking towards making a website to host a bunch of the content I've 
generated over the years. I've used WordPress, Square Space, Myspace... All of
them left me overwhelmed. They had so many features I did not care about or use.
I just want a simple front page with an easy to navigate index that displays
text and maybe a few images. $/<a href=https://github.com/dylan-araps>dylan-araps</a> built a website that was basically
that, and was kind enough to license his work under the MIT license. As a
result, this website can now exist. Many, many thanks to him and all the work he
has done that I have had the privilege to use. 

What follows is his own description of how this site works:
This is not your run-of-the-mill website. It is not generated from something
like Markdown, nor is it written in HTML. Each page is simply a .txt file which
is inserted into &lt;pre&gt; tags that reside in a tiny template.

The template contains the CSS, favicon, sidebar and the few HTML elements needed
to house the content. Each resulting HTML file is fully self-contained.
Everything listed above is embedded into each file.

Thanks to this "static" model, each page on this website takes up a single HTTP
request. One can simply use curl to grab a page and it'll render in the browser
offline and as intended.

This remains quick despite the loss in caching as each page is no larger than
3-10 kilobytes. See: <a href=https://tools.pingdom.com/#5ca38087eb000000>https://tools.pingdom.com/#5ca38087eb000000</a>

/* 
    Providing some kind of inline favicon is the only way to quiet the browser
    and prevent it from trying to load something non-existent. Prior to creating
    the above favicon, this website used the following snippet.
    
    &lt;link href=data:, rel=icon&gt;
    
    Through a lot of tinkering I found that this is the smallest possible
    (inline) favicon. This successfully shushes the web request in all tested
    browsers.
