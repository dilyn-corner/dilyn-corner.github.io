Git Yourself A Mirror
________________________________________________________________________________

Given that KISS is a project fundamentally served by VCS, finding a way to
reliably serve our repositories is one of the most important feature of the
distribution. Because GitHub is owned by Microsoft and has been experiencing
more and more server problems as time goes on, there has always been a call from
the KISS community to use an alternative repository hosting platform. 

But even if you don't have git repositories used by literally tens of people,
there are good reasons to move away from GitHub! Reliability, freedom, control,
and knowledge are all sufficient reasons to make the Great Migration(tm).
Luckily for us, git is distinct enough from GitHub that self-hosting your own
repositories is incredibly simple! There are plenty of options if you decide to
go this way. One of my personal favorites is Gitea <a href=#1>[1]</a>. Other people are big
fans of Source Hut <a href=#2>[2]</a>. Because source Hut aims to provide a full-featured suite
of features including a mailing list, a wiki, and a bug tracker, packaging it is
a bit trickier and more involved than I like. I prefer simple, straightforward
options, with as few moving parts as possible (that's why this site is served on
static pages, of course!). So instead, we will utilize another tool: stagit <a href=#3>[3]</a>. 

This is the third part of my Server series. It works off of the same Linode
created in @/<a href=/blog/Server.>Server.</a> Adapt to your own needs!

Unlike my @/<a href=/blog/Server-Mail>Server-Mail</a> article, there is basically zero work to do. Expect this
to be a much shorter post.

<span id=1.0><a href=#1.0>[1.0]</a></span> Setup the user and repositories
________________________________________________________________________________

One of the most important features a server can have (especially one that holds
potentially sensitive information) is a nonprivileged user. This user's entire
job is to simply serve our git repositories and manage them for us. Their home
directory will be coopted for our needs, their desires eschewed for the Greater
Good(tm), and their agency stripped to make way for more important things. 

# adduser vcs
# passwd vcs
# su - vcs

You can put vcs' home directory wherever you would like; I'm fine with /home/vcs
because there isn't much of importance on this server, and /home feels homey.
Just remember wherever you put their home directory for the future - we're going
to be serving our git repositories out of it. 

Speaking of which, we need to do that! 

The simplest way is to just create a bare repository, because we won't ever
actually be doing any work out of it. 

# git init --bare repo.git

So simple. 

Next we have to populate this repository with all of our local work. If you plan
on mirroring your repository, do something like the first command. If instead
you're wanting to migrate from your current git host (like GitHub) to your own
server, use the second command:

# git remote add mirror vcs@IPAddress:repo.git
# git remot set-url origin vcs@IPAddress:repo.git

Do a `git remote -v` to make sure that the old or new remote (named mirror) has
the correct IP address, user name, and path (:repo.git is of course short for
:~/repo.git). 

TIP: if you changed the default SSH port from 22 on your server (as you should),
you can do: 

# cat >> ~/.ssh/config << EOF
Host IPAddress
    port PORT
EOF

This will ensure that your SSH connection to that server (in any instance) uses
that port by default. Very useful. 
Repeat this as necessary; I ended up mirroring KISS' repo, community, kiss
itself, the init, the website, and the wiki. 

git has a powerful tool called hooks we're going to be making use of in the next
section. hooks are just actions git will take after a certain type of event
happens - they're incredibly powerful tools <a href=#4>[4]</a>. Unfortunately for us, there
isn't a post-push hook. So either remember to push to your mirror when you make
your regular pushes, or setup an alias of some sort to handle doing it for you!


<span id=2.0><a href=#2.0>[2.0]</a></span> Stagit
________________________________________________________________________________

Next we are going to setup Stagit. Stagit will magically index our entire bare
repository and generate some pretty static pages for us to show off our work.
It's got some nice features, and it's very simplistic. $/<a href=https://github.com/armaanb,>armaanb,</a> a wonderful
member of our blessed KISS Community, actually forked stagit to add some useful
features and modifications to it, like faster syntax highlighting! Check it out
on his Source Hut page <a href=#5>[5]</a>.

Add owner and description files to our repositories for stagit to use:

# echo "My Cool Name" > repo.git/owner
# echo "My Cool Repo" > repo.git/description

stagit should be run in the directory where all the pages are to end up.
Ideally, it happens every time our server's repository receives a push, that way
we don't have to do it manually every time. This is the where the beautiful
magic of git hooks come in:

# cat >> repo.git/hooks/post-receive << EOF
#!/bin/sh -e 

repo="$PWD"
dst="/var/www/git.domain.tld/$(basename "$(pwd)" '.git')"

mkdir -p "$dst"
(cd "$dst" && stagit "$repo")
ln -sf "$dst/index.html" "$dst/log.html"
EOF
# chmod +x repo.git/hooks/post-receive

This hook will be run by git after the repository receives some changes, after
it finishes updating. It just runs stagit in the directory we want to host the
static pages on (git.domain.tld/repo) for the repository in question. 

On your own machine, do `git push mirror` to update your repository. Next we
just need to index all of our repositories so that git.domain.tld will do
something useful - provide a page listing all of our repositories! 

# stagit-index /home/vcs/repo.git > /var/www/git.domain.tld/index.html

If you have multiple repositories you'd like to index, do them all in a single
stagit-index command. Feel free to add some stylesheets and icons to the
repository to make it yours.

In order to checkout this new webpage we've made, we should setup a webserver
for it. You can do something as simple as `httpd /var/www/git.domain.tld`, but
if you want to serve it over https you can always use something like caddy; it's
basically a one-click way to quickly get a website up. Feel free to do it
however you want; I have a caddy file and caddy comes with a service:

# cat > /etc/caddy/caddy.conf << EOF
<a href=http://git.domain.tld>http://git.domain.tld</a> {
    redir <a href=https://git.domain.tld>https://git.domain.tld</a>
}
<a href=https://git.domain.tld>https://git.domain.tld</a> {
    root * /var/www/git.domain.tld
    file_server
}
EOF

# ln -sv /etc/sv/caddy/ /var/service/
# sv up caddy

Caddy has a ton of options, there are plenty of ways to do this, bla bla bla.
Run your site as you see fit! Make an MX record for your site with your
registrar, having git.domain.tld point to your server's IP address, and you
should be good to go!

Now you can visit your site and see the beauty of your work <a href=#7>[7]</a>. I still need to
work on my stylesheet, which I ungraciously swiped from <a href=#8>[8]</a>. Thank you for your
work and effort, Roman.


<span id=3.0><a href=#3.0>[3.0]</a></span> The Git Daemon
________________________________________________________________________________

If you try to git clone your repository however, you're going to have a bad
time. You have to do one final trick, so that the repository changes from
look-but-don't-clone to look-but-don't-push. It's actually quite simple, if you
just want to serve it from git://git.domain.tld/repo - we're going to take
advantage of the git-daemon!

# touch /home/vcs/repo.git/git-daemon-export-ok
# mkdir -p /etc/sv/git-daemon
# echo >> /etc/sv/git-daemon/run << EOF
#!/bin/sh

exec git daemon --reuseaddr --base-path=/home/vcs/ /home/vcs/
EOF
# chmod +x /etc/sv/git-daemon/run 
# ln -sv /etc/sv/git-daemon/ /var/service/
# sv up git-daemon

Now you should find that your repositories are quite cloneable. ezclap

I told you it'd be a short one. Serving your own git repositories is probably
one of the easiest things to self host. The entire infrastructure is already
there for you! Here's a bonus section:

# mkdir -p /var/www/fossil.domain.tld
# cat >> /home/vcs/repo.git/hooks/post-receive << EOF

fdst="/var/www/fossil.domain.tld/$(basename "$(pwd)" '.git')"

git fast-export --import-marks="$fdst/git.marks" \
    --export-marks="$fdst/git.marks" --all | fossil import --git \
    --incremental --import-marks "$fdst/fossil.marks" \
    --export-marks "$fdst/fossil.marks" "${fdst}.fossil"
(cd "$fdst" && fossil push)
EOF

# mkdir -p /etc/sv/fossil-server
# cat >> /etc/sv/fossil-server/run << EOF
#!/bin/sh

exec fossil server --https --port XXXX --repolist /var/www/fossil.domain.tld
EOF
# chmod +x /etc/sv/fossil-server/run
# ln -sv /etc/sv/fossil-server/ /var/service/
# sv up fossil-server

On your local machine:
# git push mirror

Add a wiki page who's title is the name of the repository file to have the
welcome page for the repo be that wiki, and you'll be greeted by a shiny
one-to-one fossil mirror <a href=#9>[9]</a> of your beloved git repository, inching one step
closer to dropping the GPL infected git :v

Bonus points if you implement fossil support in kiss before I do.
