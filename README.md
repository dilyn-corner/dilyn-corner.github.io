# My little website

Congratulations, you've solved my _source puzzle_.  
This is the source for my first website in over a decade!

## Roadmap

The goals are shakey at best. I'm not sure if this is a professional site.  
Probably not. 

-[] Philosophy papers
* This is for archival purposes, mainly. I don't plan on pushing anything new. 
-[] Maths stuff
* Notes, thoughts, references. Perhaps study guides. IDK.
-[] Linux
* December marked my real foray into linux. We should document things. 
-[] Coding
* I plan on learning more R, truly learning some Python, and getting into C. 
-[] ???

## Why? 

This site is mainly just going to develop into a hub dedicated to all of my content. I don't have Twitter (anymore, rip ten years of my life), I don't use Facebook or Instagram (not enough to warrant having the accounts), I don't update my LinkedIn often. Github sees the most action from me, and I'm not even a coder! 


Mainly, this is just another part of my grand adventure.
