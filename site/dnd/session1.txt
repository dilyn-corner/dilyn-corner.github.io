This is a skeleton/test/proof-of-concept on how I plan to store session notes,
images, fun facts, etc.

This is meant as a reference for players both before, during, and after
sessions. Feel free to come back here as often as you like; we'll see what
happens!

Here is an aerial view of Candlekeep:

And a view at an angle. Don't mind the dugeon in the top right, it isn't
supremely relevant:
