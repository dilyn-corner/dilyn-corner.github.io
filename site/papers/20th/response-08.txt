Reading Response – Week 13


Originally when I had read Carnap’s ''Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology'',
it was for Professor Grey’s Metaphysics course. We had introduced it with
the primary focus on answering questions of existence. We compared the idea with
other ideas of existence and how certain things existing commit us to certain
ontologies. For instance, Quine requires that we are committed to the existence
of any bound variable in the existential quantifier, at least for any of our
scientific theories. Carnap’s idea about frameworks seems quite closely
related to this. However, for Carnap, it seems that Quine’s position is but
one of many distinct possibilities that we could choose. Indeed, other papers we
read in that course, such as Meinong’s work on fictional objects, also seem
as though they can be accommodated by Carnap’s work. The position itself
seems reasonable: we admit the existence of certain entities insofar as they
provide useful for the kind of work we are doing. Electrons exist because our
physical theories are well-equipped to deal with them; we can speak of them,
describe their properties, and so on. It would be outrageous for us to say,
“the electron has such properties as these, but it does not exist”.
However, it seems hard to commit those who do not share our theories – about
more than ‘science’, especially – to the existence of what our
theories posit. Carnap argues that the decisions about which framework to use
are largely pragmatic ones. While this sounds remarkably similar to Wittgenstein
in ''On Certainty'', I am more convinced by Wittgenstein than Carnap on this
matter.<ref name="ftn1">I am not entirely certain why this is the case; perhaps
I just like Wittgenstein more? It might have something to do with the fact that
I take Wittgenstein to be saying “there are many choices, none of which are
wholly correct”, whereas it feels as though Carnap wants to point at a
particular framework and say “this is it; this is the one framework to rule
them all”. </ref> It seems terribly difficult to ''convince someone'' that
their theory is incorrect, or that yours isn’t, on pragmatic grounds alone.
Pragmatic reasons also don’t seem to be the correct sorts of reasons for
choosing certain theories in the first place. For instance, it doesn’t seem
like the pragmatic choice to choose skeptical or antirealist theories over
realist ones. Indeed, under Carnap’s position, it seems that the lack of
pragmatic reasons for accepting something like idealism would be a strike
against such a theory, but a strike in what way? If the logic we choose or the
principles we prefer also fall under a framework, then it seems that these ways
of weighing theories against each other is circular. I guess the point I’m
trying to make here is analogous to the point Graham Priest attempts to make in
favor of paraconsistent logic. Our reasons for accepting the law of excluded
middle are either ungrounded or circular; insofar as Graham Priest has failed to
convince me that paraconsistent logic is the way to go, Carnap’s argument
that pragmatic reasons are how we justify frameworks loses ground.
