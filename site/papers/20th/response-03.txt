Reading Response – Week 7


Right off the bat in the 1<sup>st</sup> edition preface to Language, Truth, and
Logic, Ayer brings up what seems to be the analytic synthetic distinction. He
says on Hume’s ‘relations of ideas’ and ‘matters of fact’
that “the former class comprises the a priori propositions of logic and pure
mathematics, and these I allow to be necessary and certain only because they are
analytic… Propositions concerning empirical matters of fact, on the other
hand, I hold to be hypotheses, which can be probable but never certain”
(31). He does not name the matters of fact as synthetic propositions, but from
what I understand of Hume this is to be the case. However, his
‘allowance’ of the analytic to be necessary solely because they are
analytic and that of the synthetic to be contingent solely because of their
synthetic nature seems dubious. In my first reading response, I asked the
question of whether or not it was the case that the analytic-synthetic
distinction amounted to a discussion of contingent facts versus necessary
truths, and the comments you provided seem to directly contradict what Ayer is
saying here. Would this be a correct understanding of Ayer’s position on the
distinction? If this is indeed the case, it lessens my troubles with the
analytic-synthetic distinction, if only because I now feel vindicated in
rejecting the notion of a synthetic proposition. As a strict necessetarian, I
frequently found myself unable to be convinced by discussions on whether certain
purportedly synthetic statements (“water is H<sub>2</sub>O”) were
actually synthetic. What seems synthetic seems to me to reduce to simply not
knowing enough about the words in question (for instance, not being aware of the
chemical composition of water), and not that these things could have merely
‘been otherwise’ (as I don’t know what it would mean to be water and
not be water, in a sense). If Ayer’s take on the distinction is precisely a
contingent versus necessary divide, then it seems to only harm his empiricist
position – all truths that are determined would actually be necessarily the
case (if they are actually true), and the scientific enterprise amounts to
determining which facts are facts and which facts are confusions. While this
would indeed appear to be his primary aim, it simply seems to point out that we
cannot know what are facts without adequately refined scientific mechanisms,
which is problematic if part of his position is a pragmatic or empiricist one
rather than a rational one (I don’t think Ayer would like to claim that all
truths are in principle knowable). From what I have read later on in this book,
the distinction isn’t something that is worrying me much more beyond this,
but it is certainly something worth considering.
