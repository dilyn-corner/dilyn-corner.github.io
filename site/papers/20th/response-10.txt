Reading Response – Week 16


This week I just want to ask a few clarificatory questions. Last class we were
asked if we understood the project Sellars was embarking on and I certainly
couldn’t figure out what his goals were. The discussion which followed was
illuminating and informative, and hopefully my following discussion about my
confusions, in tandem with applying Sellars’ approach and position to it
will better elucidate his point. 

The place I would like to start is perhaps at the beginning: what precisely is
‘sense data’. The concept itself seems confused to me. The empiricist
originally, beginning all the way with Locke and his primary and secondary
qualities, wanted to embed certain facts about objects within the objects
themselves. The property of having a smell, a shape, a color, a density, a
weight, a size, etc. were facts in the object or they were extensions that we
gathered through our sense perceptions (if I am properly understanding
Locke’s distinction between primary and secondary qualities). Kant, while
not an empiricist, certainly attempted to unify empiricist and rationalist ideas
by using an approach which sought to bear out the properties of objects as
impositions on our concepts through a ‘unification’ of a manifold which
the ‘thing in itself’ impressed upon us. In this way, properties were
simultaneously of the noumena and the phenomena. Throughout this
two-hundred-year historical arc, it seems that most people of the nonidealist
camp wanted to impress upon us that the objects which we perceive have these
properties we experience in very real kinds of ways. Sellars seems to want to
split this connection. 

Like Wittgenstein, Sellars seems to be putting this notion of objects and
meaning on its head. While Wittgenstein was far more concerned with meaning and
justification in general, Sellars seems primarily motivated to ground our sense
perceptions themselves in a kind of justificatory practice. It seems that
Sellars wants us to say that we sense particular facts and they generate
knowledge if it is the case that we can justifiably believe these perceptions to
be the case. '''(If this is horribly incorrect please correct me
immediately!)''' My first question is, how does such a view hold up against
Gettier-style problems of knowledge? It seems that our fallibility of perception
would be in part due to our fallibility of knowing in general, and this seems to
be something which Sellars takes quite seriously. But this leads me to my next
point. 

Why do we want to attribute ''knowledge'' to the act of sense perceptions in the
first place? This might perhaps seem radical or ridiculous; I’m not aware of
anyone who has suggested this. But it seems that in general we want knowledge to
be a kind of immutable thing; we know ''facts'' about the world – the things
which we know cannot undergo revision because then it doesn’t seem to be the
case that we can be credited with knowledge at all. But sense perceptions are
not about the world, but instead they are about our interactions with the world
as it is. Take for instance, deer. There is a very good reason why they stare at
your headlights when you’re driving fifty miles an hour down the road and
want them to move so you don’t hit them: they perceive the speed of your car
differently than you do. This is primarily due to the ‘refresh rate’ of
their eyes; we see things at a different frequency than them (this is why, for
instance, movies are always shot at 29.97 frames per second: it’s the
perfect frequency for our eyes; likewise why lights seem to not be flickering;
they are, you just can’t tell because it happens too fast for your eyes to
pick up on). Mantis shrimp see far more colors than humans do; if we could see
the microwave spectrum of light, we would see a very different world. What I
guess I’m trying to say is that the world appears to us in particular kinds
of ways not because the world is a certain way, but because ''we ''are a certain
way. It isn’t because we’re limited or fallible or finite or whatever
reason which has been put forward historically; it is because our bodies are
built in a particular kind of way which makes the way we perceive ''the way we
perceive''. We are not seeing the world as it is, much like Kant believed. We
are seeing the world the way that ''we'' see the world. Can we actually be
credited of having sensory knowledge of the world if this is the case? It seems
only than we can be charged with seeing the world how we see the world.
