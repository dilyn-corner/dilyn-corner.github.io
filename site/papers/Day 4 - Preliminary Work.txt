'''I: Objections and Alternatives'''


Objection/Alternative 1: This is an objection to Argument Point 1, that the relationship is an antithesis ''as ''an antithesis. 


It isn’t the case in ''Metaphysics ''IX.6 that the point being made is to show that actuality and potentiality are antithetical positions. Instead, it is a point to demonstrate how they relate across a spectrum. Aristotle here is confirming that, in fact, actuality and potentiality are in some relevant way different sides of a similar coin. They are, as it turns out, a state of being in a capacity to do something and being in the activity of doing that thing. What this means is that the actuality and potentiality being described are of the first and second kind, respectively. Thus, this is not a rejection of the point made in ''De Anima'', but instead an elaboration on the nature of the soul and body’s relationship. 


Objection/Alternative 2: This is an objection to Argument Point 3, that the soul is only spoken of in ''De Anima'' as the first actuality of the body. 


This argument misses entire sections covered later in book II about the nature of the soul and its relation to the body. Aristotle further elaborates in ''DA ''II.3 that the soul is ''not ''a movement [citation needed], and that it is in fact also the cause of the body: the soul is substantial cause of the material thing [citation needed; ''DA ''II.5 I believe). In this way, it is much more than just the first actuality of the body having life potentially. Indeed, it is the cause of the body. 




'''II: Responses'''


These objections both present things that I had failed to consider in my original draftings of these arguments specifically and my thesis more generally. In order to present a more coherent representation of Aristotle’s position, I have elected to strongly consider rewriting my entire paper. In light of this change, my '''new''' objections/alternatives will be a combination of the argument points which I raise here, tweaked slightly. The thesis will most likely be about an apparent problem with Aristotle’s understanding of the soul, but I will provide a resolution pulling from both myself and Thomas’ paper. My resolution will be a focus on Aristotle’s position that the soul is not a movement of the body, which I think is possibly one of the strongest objections that could be raised to Aristotle’s position (see Argument Point 4, revised version in the blue book). 




'''III: Detailed Statements About Source'''


The article I have chosen is:


Johansen, Thomas K. “Capacity and Potentiality: Aristotle’s Metaphysics .6-7 from the

Perspective of the De Anima.” Topoi 31.2 (2011): 209-20. Web. 


Johansen’s article contains arguments against my thesis. I will discuss and refute two of them in the next writing assignment (Objections/Alternatives and Responses): 


# The first objection to my thesis in Johansen’s article is a point he makes about what Aristotle means by ‘potential’ and ‘actual’ in ''Metaphysics''. He points out that the examples Aristotle provides to make his point in ''Metaphysics'' are “refer[ing] to the same thing in different states, none of them [are] refer[ing] to the changing of that thing from one state to the other” (Johansen 213). This means that the distinction being drawn is not one of first potentiality/second actuality, but instead one about second potentiality/first actuality, a key point the understanding why my thesis might be false. 
# The second objection to my thesis in Johansen’s article is about how the soul is the actuality of the body. Not only is it the first actuality of the body (both Johansen, Aristotle, and I are in agreement on this point), but it is also the second actuality of the body insofar as it is the teleological cause of the body. What this means is that the soul isn’t like a movement, a point Aristotle refutes in ''DA ''II.3, but is instead more like activity as fulfilment (Johansen 219).
